# Connected-graph-generator
This neat little script randomly generates a connected graph consisting of n vertices in the form of an adjacency matrix. This generated graph can then be used to test any graph related algorithm that requires a connected graph. 
The output of the graph will be a text file under your project directory named "connected_graph.txt".
